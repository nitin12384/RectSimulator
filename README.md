1. Download the 32-bit compiler . Link : https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/ 
Download this file "MinGW.org based tdm-gcc-10.3.0.exe, 60.2 MB"

2. Download graphics.h library files . Link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/16xZBvFXf7yFjxwTpuyevK1KPuLgUeZFh/view
These files are required : 
- graphics.h
- winbgim.h
- libbgi.a

3. Install the compiler, and place .h files in /include folder of compiler and .a file in /lib folder of compiler
Notes : 
- Uncheck "Check for updated files of TDM-GCC server"
